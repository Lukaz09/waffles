        <p style="color:aliceblue; font-size: larger;">It began when I first drank mountain dew. I thought that it was the greatest thing I had ever tasted. The flavors exploded across every tastebud and the fizziness bubbled across every inch of my tongue. But the I couldn't breathe. I had a strong allergic reaction to mountain dew. I was rushed to the hospital and told I could never have it unless it was stored/soaked in some other carbohydrate. I tried soaking it in bread, but it wasn't nearly the same feeling or taste. I then started up baking, to put my efforts towards substitutes that I could make my mountain dew into. In my search, there were no mountain dew baking recipes, because of course there wouldn't be, why would there. So, I went and searched. I dove to the depths of the pacific and extracted ice from magical glaciers. And the most difficult to get, was the extracted dew from the Lime Spiders.</p>

        <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: larger;">In all my travels for the most magical ingredients in the entire lands, I found the Lime Spider. Containing the dew needed for mountain dew a quality 1,000 times higher than that of normal and average mountain dew. It's smell alone made me see heaven. I began to work. I found countless other ingredients like from the gallery page. These allowed me to craft heavenly pieces of art. Deserts. True deserts. The plethora of deserts I have made thus far is not far nor wide, but each one enhances life as a whole and makes you feel as if you have changed entirely.</p>
